# Xinput_GamePad_Controller

Slightly better version of the xinput implementation for unity based on the amazing work done by speps (https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet), allows to control four gamepads with a very simple to use API and easily map computer inputs to gamepad button using a custom inspector.
